# Tiger Direct
ICS3U project

This is an offline version of the webstore [TigerDirect](www.tigerdirect.ca). Includes adding items to the shopping cart, manipulating the cart, and an employee interface to add/remove items, change the stock of items, and employee settings, such as adding new employees and changing their permissions, plus changing usernames and passwords.

If you are our teacher, your username is `klaassen` and your password is `teacher`.
